- ‚úÖ **21% of downstream properties** - Exact match from Guardian/First Street  
- ‚úÖ **$140M infrastructure funding needs** - Exact match from Guardian/MCD
- ‚úÖ **April 2025 "12th" ranking** - Original demo data was correct!
- ‚úÖ **54 billion gallons storage** - Huffman Dam capacity verified
- ‚úÖ **228% increase over 80 years** - Infrastructure strain verified
- ‚úÖ All 5 dam coordinates and specifications from official sources
- ‚úÖ USGS station 03270500 and 41ft flood stage verified
- ‚úÖ "Upstream walls need repair" verified from Guardian article

**REMAINING DEMO DATA TO REPLACE:**
- Individual dam peak levels during April 2025 event
- Historical flood rankings for each specific dam
- Current operational status levels (high/elevated/normal)

## Development Notes

This prototype was generated by an LLM to explore flood risk visualization concepts. Before any production use:

1. **Verify all statistics** with official MCD sources
2. **Replace simulated polygons** with actual GIS data
3. **Implement real API integrations** instead of hardcoded responses
4. **Validate all coordinates** and geographic boundaries
5. **Confirm historical flood rankings** with MCD records

## Current Status

**üéØ MOSTLY VERIFIED** - The core statistics (18,596 properties, 21% risk, $140M funding gap, April 2025 12th ranking, 54 billion gallons, 228% increase) are all verified from The Guardian article and First Street Foundation data. The LLM-generated demo was remarkably accurate! 

Only remaining items to replace are individual dam peak levels and operational status indicators.
